Summary Statement
This study explores the important criteria that need to be met to successfully use accelerometers
on marine acoustic biologging tags to confirm caller-id in baleen whales.

Abstract
Multi-sensor acoustic tags have revolutionized our understanding of the behavior of large
whales. Their limitation, however, is the inability to reliably distinguish calls produced by the
tagged whale from those produced by other nearby whales. One proposed solution has been to
detect calls using both hydrophone and accelerometer data to identify signals produced by the
tagged animal. Some high-amplitude low-frequency calls can be detected with accelerometers,
but the success in using this approach with all calls within and across species is variable. Here
we provide guidance on the role of the physics of sound propagation and the tag hardwareâ€™s
accelerometer capabilities for successful application of this method with examples from tag data
collected from fin whales (Balaenoptera physalus), blue whales (B. musculus), and southern
right whales (Eubalaena australis). Of 1190 high amplitude calls believed to like be from the
tagged animal, only 51.7% were also detected on the accelerometer. Reasons for lack of
detection were primarily the frequency of the signal lying outside the usable frequency detection
range of the accelerometer on the tag.

The script allows for batch processing of audio and accelerometer data from tags.
